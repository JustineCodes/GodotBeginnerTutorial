My first game, Woot woot! 

I find trying new things an adventure as I never know how long they will hold my attention. I had to push a bit to complete this one, and the fact that I had that energy means a lot to me. I have always been an artest, but I struggle with the limitations and challenges that come from creating art outside of the virtual world. 

This was a wonderful use of long weekend. (4 days off!)
